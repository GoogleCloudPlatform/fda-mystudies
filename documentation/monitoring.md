# Logging and Monitoring

This page describes the process for configuring logging and monitoring of an FDA MyStudies deployment.

Cloud Logging can be used to configure a log viewer for viewing, querying, and analysis of logs. Log sinks can be set up to manage log retention policies. Cloud Logging can also be used to create log-based metrics and alerts.

Cloud Monitoring is used for setting up charts, dashboards, alerts, and notifications. It also can be used for Service Level Objective (SLO) monitoring and uptime checks.

## 1.  Cloud Logging

Cloud Logging API can be used for real-time log management analysis by configuring the following components:

*   Logs viewer           
*   Logs alerting
*   Logs Router, Retention & Storage 
*   Log buckets and views
*   Error Reporting
*   Audit Logging

### Logs viewer 

Logs Viewer and Logs Explorer can be used to filter and analyze logs during an incident.

### Logs alerting

Logs-based alerting is integrated with [Cloud Monitoring](https://cloud.google.com/monitoring) and can be used to set alerts on the logs events.

### Logs Router, Retention & Storage 

Cloud Logging uses two predefined log sinks for each GCP Project `_Required` and `_Default`. All logs that are generated in GCP projects are automatically processed through these two log sinks and then are stored in the correspondingly named log buckets. Cloud Logging doesn't charge to route logs, but destination charges may apply.

Bucket Configurations:

| Name | Description | Monthly | Retention | Type |
|------|-------------|---------|-----------|------|
| _Default | Default bucket | Billable | 30 days | global |
| _Required | Audit bucket | Not billed | 400 days | global |

### Log buckets and views

Logs Storage is used to create logs buckets and to monitor usage and retention.

### Error Reporting

Error Reporting API can be used to aggregate and display errors produced in the running cloud services. The centralized error management interface can be used to find errors during the deployments and infrastructure update process.

### Cloud Audit Logs

Cloud Audit Logs can be used to help meet security, auditing, and compliance needs by maintaining audit trails such as admin activity, data access, and system events. These are configured to be stored in coldline storage for longer-term storage.

| Name | Location  | Type | Life  Cycle |
|------|-------------|---------|-----------|
| `<PREFIX>-<ENV>-7yr-audit-logs` | Region | Coldline | 2555+ days since object was update |

## 2.  Cloud Monitoring

The Cloud Monitoring services will be used to monitor the project resources. Different monitoring and alerts are set up for the various projects involved in a deployment, including:

*   Apps - the project storing container images and running the compute (k8s) resources
*   Audit - the project storing audit logs from the platform and applications
*   Data - the project with the CloudSQL databases
*   Devops - the project for the CI/CD pipeline
*   Firebase - the project used for storing study response data
*   Networks - the project for the network policies and firewalls
*   Secrets - the project for managing the deployment secrets such as client IDs and credentials

### Monitoring Methods

The types of monitoring used include:

*   Dashboard Monitoring
*   Metrics based alerts with email notifications
*   Logs based alerts with email notifications
*   Incident monitoring dashboard

### Apps Project

## 3. Configuring Alerts and Notifications

#### Configuring Monitoring Dashboards

To configure monitoring dashboards go to the [Dashboards Overview](https://console.cloud.google.com/monitoring/dashboards) page in the Monitoring section of the console and use the project selector at the top to select the project. Use the `Create Dashboard` button to create individual dashboards and then configure the recommended resources for the project.

**Configure Notification Channels**

When creating an alerting policy, you can select a configured notification channel and add it to your policy. You can pre-configure your notification channels, or you can configure them as part of the process of creating an alerting policy.

Email notification channels can also be created during the creation of an alerting policy. For more information, see[ Creating a channel on demand.](https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/support/notification-options#on-demand) If you use a group email address as the notification channel for an alerting policy, make sure the group is configured to allow incoming mail from `[alerting-noreply@google.com](mailto:alerting-noreply@google.com)`.

To configure a notification channel, you must have one of the following Identity and Access Management roles on the project being monitored

*   `Monitoring Notification Channel Editor`
*   `Monitoring Editor`
*   `Monitoring Admin`
*   `Project Editor`
*   `Project Owner`

A notification channel must be created for each project. Use the following steps to configure a notification channel:

*   Go to the [Alerting](https://console.cloud.google.com/monitoring/alerting) page in the Monitoring section of the console and use the project selector at the top to select the project
*   Click the `Edit Notification Channels` button
*   If creating an email channel, locate the channel type `Email`, click `Add New` and follow the instructions
*   If creating another type of notification channel such as a mobile app, PagerDuty, SMS, Slack, Pub/Sub, or webhooks, see the instructions for [Creating channels](https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/support/notification-options#creating_channels). 

#### Configuring Uptime Checks

*   Go to the [Uptime checks](https://console.cloud.google.com/monitoring/uptime) page in the Monitoring section of the console and use the project selector at the top to select the project
*   Click `Create Uptime Check`
*   Enter a descriptive title such as: `Auth-Server-Health Check`
*   In the Target, select the protocol `HTTPS`
*   Choose the Resource Type `URL`
*   Enter the hostname and path as specified in the project instructions above
*   Select a frequency of how often you would like to run the checks
*   If you want to only run checks from certain geographic regions, you can edit this in `More Target Options`
*   Select a value for the response timeout to use and make sure the box `Log check failures` is checked to save errors to Cloud Logging
*   Give the alert a name and select one of your pre-configured notification channels
*   Verify the configuration using the `Test` button and then `Create` once the settings are confirmed

#### Configuring Metrics Based Alerts

*   Go to the [Alerting](https://console.cloud.google.com/monitoring/alerting) page in the Monitoring section of the console and use the project selector at the top to select the project
*   Click on the `Create Policy` button
*   Click `Add Condition`
*   Search for the target resource type, metric, and condition specified in the project recommendations above
*   After adding the condition, select one of your pre-configured notification channels and add auto-close duration before reviewing the configuration and creating the policy

#### Configuring Logs Based Alerts

*   Go to the [Logs Explorer](https://console.cloud.google.com/logs/query) page in the Logging section of the console and use the project selector at the top to select the project
*   In the Query field enter the metrics query specified in the project recommendations above and then run the query to validate the results
*   In the query results pane click on the `Actions` menu and then `Create log alert`
*   In the alert details pane, add a name and description
*   In `Choose logs to include in the alert` check the query and results by clicking `Preview logs`
*   Select a minimum time between notifications
*   Select one of your pre-configured notification channels and save the alert
