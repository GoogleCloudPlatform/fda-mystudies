# Short helper script to run repetitive commands for Kubernetes deployments.
# Args:
# kubeapply.sh <project> <region> <cluster>
#
# It does the following:
#  * Activates the cluster for kubectl via `gcloud container clusters get-credentials`.
#  * Applies the pod security policies.
#  * Applies the cert configuration.
#  * Applies all deployments from children of the parent folder.
#  * Applies all services from children of the parent folder.
#  * Applies the ingress configuration
#
# The services and deployments should be applied separately.
#
# Requires existence of files ./pod_security_policy{,-istio}.yaml.
# Currently hardcoded to use projects "heroes-hat-dev-{apps,data}".
#
# Run like:
# $ ./kubernetes/kubeapply.sh heroes-hat-cluster

if [ "$#" -ne 1 ]; then
  echo 'Please provide exactly 1 argument in the order of <cluster>'
