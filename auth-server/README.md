# Overview
The **FDA MyStudies** [`Auth server`](../auth-server/) is the centralized authentication mechanism for the various client applications of the MyStudies platform.
 
The client applications are:
1. [`Android mobile application`](../Android/)
1. [`iOS mobile application`](../iOS/)
1. [`Participant manager`](../participant-manager/)
 
The `Auth server`provides the following functionality:
1. User registration
1. User credentials management
1. User authentication
1. User logout
1. Server-to-server authentication support
 
The `Auth server` identity management application is built as a Spring Boot application that implements user login and consent flows. It integrates with your deployment’s instance of [ORY Hydra](https://www.ory.sh/hydra/) for token generation and management.
 
# Deployment
> **_NOTE:_** Holistic deployment of the **FDA MyStudies** platform with Terraform and infrastructure-as-code is the recommended approach to deploying this component. A step-by-step guide to semi-automated deployment can be found in the [`deployment/`](/deployment) directory. The following instructions are provided in case manual deployment in a VM is required. Google Cloud infrastructure is indicated, but equivalent alternative infrastructure can be used as well. It is important for the deploying organization to consider the identity and access control choices made when configuring the selected services. If pursuing a manual deployment, a convenient sequence is [`hydra/`](/hydra)&rarr;[`auth-server/`](/auth-server/)&rarr;[`participant-datastore/`](/participant-datastore/)&rarr;[`participant-manager-datastore/`](/participant-manager-datastore/)&rarr;[`participant-manager/`](/participant-manager/)&rarr;[`study-datastore/`](/study-datastore/)&rarr;[`response-datastore/`](/response-datastore/)&rarr;[`study-builder/`](/study-builder/)&rarr;[`Android/`](/Android/)&rarr;[`iOS/`](/iOS/).
 
To deploy the [`Auth server`](/auth-server/) manually:
1. [Create](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/instances/create-start-instance) a Compute Engine VM instance with your preferred machine type and OS (for example, e2-medium and Debian 10), then [reserve a static IP](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/ip-addresses/reserve-static-internal-ip-address)
1. Verify that your VM instance has the `Stackdriver Logging API` write [access scope](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/access/service-accounts#accesscopesiam) (on by default) and that your VM’s [service account](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/access/service-accounts#default_service_account) has the [`Logs Writer`](https://cloud.google.com/logging/docs/access-control) role (off by default) 
1. Check out the latest code from the [FDA MyStudies repository](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/fda-mystudies/)
1. Optional. If desired, replace the landing page image [`landingpage-logo.png`](oauth-scim-service/src/main/resources/static/images/landingpage-logo.png) (do not change filename)
1. Create a Cloud SQL instance with MySQL v5.7 ([instructions](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/create-instance))
1. Configure the `Auth server` database on the Cloud SQL instance
    -    Create a user account that the `Auth server` application will use to access this instance ([instructions](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/create-manage-users))
    -    Create a database named `oauth_server_hydra` with the [`mystudies_oauth_server_hydra_db_script.sql`](sqlscript/mystudies_oauth_server_hydra_db_script.sql) script ([instructions](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/import-export/importing#importing_a_sql_dump_file))
    -   Enable the database’s private IP connectivity in the same network as your VM ([instructions](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/configure-private-ip))
1. To enable `https`, obtain a certificate from a certificate authority or prepare a self-signed certificate
    -   For example, if you included the host name of this VM instance in the list of *Subject Alternative Names* in the certificate that you created during `Hydra` deployment, you could use `openssl pkcs12 -export -password pass:changeit -out mystudies-cert.p12 -inkey <path_to_mystudies-private.key> -in <path_to_mystudies-cert.pem>` to convert that certificate for use in this deployment (where `mystudies-private.key` and `mystudies-cert.pem` are the certificate files you created during `Hydra` deployment)
1. Deploy the `Auth server` container to the VM
    -    Create the Docker image using `sudo mvn -B package -Pprod com.google.cloud.tools:jib-maven-plugin:2.5.2:dockerBuild -Dimage=auth-server-image` from the `auth-server/` directory (you may need to [install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/debian/) and Maven, for example `sudo apt install maven`)
    -    Update the Docker environment file [`variables.env`](variables.env) with the values of the [`application.properties`](oauth-scim-service/src/main/resources/application.properties) file for your deployment
    -    Run the container on your VM using `sudo docker run --detach -v ~/certs:/certs --env-file variables.env -p 443:8080  --name auth-server auth-server-image` (you may need to adjust the port to 80 if you are using `http`)
    -    If your `Hydra` instance is using a self-signed certificate, add that certificate to your container’s keystore, for example with `sudo docker exec -it auth-server bash -c "openssl s_client -connect <your_hydra_instance> | sed -ne '/-BEGIN CERTIFICATE/,/END CERTIFICATE/p' > hydra.crt; keytool -import -trustcacerts -alias hydra -file hydra.crt -keystore /usr/local/openjdk-11/lib/security/cacerts -storepass changeit"`, then restart the container with `sudo docker restart auth-server`
1. Test if the application is running with `curl -k https://0.0.0.0/auth-server/healthCheck`
1. You can review application logs in the logging directory you specified, or with `sudo docker logs auth-server`; audit logs are available in [Cloud Logging](https://cloud.google.com/logging)
