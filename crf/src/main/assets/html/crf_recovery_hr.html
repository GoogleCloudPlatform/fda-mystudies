    <title>What does my Recovery HR Score mean?</title>

<p>
    A Recovery HR Score is very similar to a VO2max.  It is a common measure of the maximum amount of oxygen you can use during excercise.  This score is a measure of your aerobic endurance that we calculate from your heart rate after exercise, your age, and your sex at birth.

    This type of testing has been done in a large number of people. So you can compare your score to a validated table of results and interpretations below:

    Your Recovery HR is usually stable over time because your heart and lungs don’t change rapidly.  However, you can change your Recovery HR Score over weeks or months by doing things like losing weight, exercising, or quitting smoking.
