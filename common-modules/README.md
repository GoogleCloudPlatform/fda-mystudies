The `Common modules` directory includes common code and tests shared by all Spring boot applications. When deploying the **FDA MyStudies** platform, [Jib](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/jib) will detect and fetch the content of `common-module/` from `pom.xml` to create the final service container.
